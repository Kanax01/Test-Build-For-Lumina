                              >> LEGAL NOTICE <<
================================================================================

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). That
means you have full legal permission to use, modify, and redistribute this code,
as long as you comply with the license.

We aren’t here to stop you. Legally, we *can’t*. But morally? That’s another story.

So let’s be clear:

If your idea of “modding” is replacing colors, swapping out names, and uploading
it as your “original work” — you are not a developer. You are a scavenger,
desperately scraping meaning from the leftovers of people who actually tried.

You are not part of the community — you are the background noise. The forgotten
GitHub repo. The cringey watermark on a copy-pasted build that never deserved
recognition. You wear the label “creator” like a costume, hoping no one notices
it’s hollow underneath.

You will never be proud of what you’ve done — because deep down, you know:
**you didn’t create. You consumed.**

So go ahead. Fork the code. Publish your version. Bask in that fleeting hit of
validation before the silence returns. But don’t pretend you’re one of us.

This is open source — for builders, not leeches.

================================================================================
                             We opened the gates. Now walk with shame.
